24,1201074258639818752,Boris Johnson,Those changes meant that although four senior judges considered that Khan was dangerous he was to be automatically released half-way through because of Labour‚Äôs 2008 law That is why we are determined to change this &amp ensure dangerous terrorists serve their full sentence (16/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,3611,1016,2019-12-01 09:43:12
25,1201074257440256000,Boris Johnson,Nowhere in the judgment did Lord Justice Leveson suggest that Khan‚Äôs release would have been subject to the Parole Board approval Indeed Lord Justice Leveson did not have the power to require that because of how Labour changed the law in 2008 (15/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,1720,495,2019-12-01 09:43:12
26,1201074255712137216,Boris Johnson,A number of people have pointed out that the judgment of the Court of Appeal makes a reference to the Parole Board If you look at the whole quote it‚Äôs clear Lord Justice Leveson is not even talking about Khan (14/16,1260983,United Kingdom,True,770,254,2019-12-01 09:43:12
27,1201074248669974528,Boris Johnson,Unfortunately Khan could not be sentenced under the EDS scheme because it was not yet in force in December 2010 when he committed the offence Had Labour not changed the law in 2008 Khan would not have been automatically released in December 2018 (13/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,1047,388,2019-12-01 09:43:10
28,1201074247550078976,Boris Johnson,If Khan had been sentenced under the new EDS scheme there would have been no automatic early release and he would only have been able to ask for Parole Board consideration at 2/3rds of his sentence Under this system he could not have been released before Mid 2021 (12/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,821,266,2019-12-01 09:43:10
29,1201074246417563648,Boris Johnson,Had the 2008 changes to the law not been made he would not have been eligible for automatic early release instead the Parole Board would have had to decide whether he was safe to be released (11/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,863,283,2019-12-01 09:43:09
30,1201074245364785152,Boris Johnson,Khan was sentenced under Labour‚Äôs old regime Therefore he was to be automatically released after serving only half of his sentence (i.e 8 years) Given time on remand this meant he was released in December 2018 (10/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,926,384,2019-12-01 09:43:09
31,1201074244219740160,Boris Johnson,However since the judges still considered him to be dangerous he got an EPP The Court of Appeal could not have given him an EDS because these were not in force when he committed the offence in December 2010 (9/16).,1260983,United Kingdom,True,733,226,2019-12-01 09:43:09
32,1201074243011780608,Boris Johnson,This means Khan would be detained indefinitely after he has served the minimum term unless the Parole Board considered him safe Khan appealed The Court of Appeal agreed that he was dangerous but felt that his crime was not serious enough to warrant an IPP (8/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,789,263,2019-12-01 09:43:09
33,1201074241875140608,Boris Johnson,Khan was sentenced by the Crown Court on 9th February 2012 He was considered dangerous by the Judge and so the two possible options available at the time were IPP or Post 2008 EPP The judge opted for IPP with a minimum term of 8 years (7/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,800,257,2019-12-01 09:43:08
34,1201074239626981376,Boris Johnson,The Prison Reform Trust has a helpful summary of how the EPP scheme changed in 2008 (6/16,1260983,United Kingdom,True,770,273,2019-12-01 09:43:08
35,1201074232953856000,Boris Johnson,In 2008 Labour introduced the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 This removed the requirement of Parole Board approval This meant that for EPPs after 2008 release would be automatic at the halfway point no matter how dangerous the criminal (5/16,1260983,United Kingdom,True,1203,611,2019-12-01 09:43:06
36,1201074226381434880,Boris Johnson,An EPP has two elements a custodial part and an extended licence period When EPPs were brought in by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 there was no automatic early release during the custodial part see s 247(2)(b of the original act (4/16,1260983,United Kingdom,True,740,218,2019-12-01 09:43:05

38,1201074218869383168,Boris Johnson,There are 4 distinct sentencing legal regimes that have been confused in this case Indefinite Sentences for Public Protection (IPP) Pre-08 Extended Sentences for Public Protection (DPP) Post-08 EPPs &amp Extended Determinate Sentences (EDS which came into force in Dec 12 (2/16),1260983,United Kingdom,True,899,255,2019-12-01 09:43:03
